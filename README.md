GettingAndCleaningData
======================

This project contains the R script "run_analysis.R"" as part of the Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment.

The purpose of this script is to read the data from "UCI HAR Dataset"" and create tidy dataset in the "Output"" folder.

The following things are taken into account while creating the tiday data set -


1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
